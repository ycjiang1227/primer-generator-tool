            All primer pairs generated from the input sequence are scored according to the following criteria:
        </body>
        <ul class = "mx-auto w-50">
            <li>G/C clamp: +1 for each primer</li>
            <li>GC content between 40% and 60%: +1 for each primer</li>
            <li>Tm between specified minimum and maximum Tm: +1 for each primer </li>
            <li>Tm within 5&#8451 of each other: +1</li>
        </ul>
        <body>The highest scoring pairs are then returned.</body>
